# Configure Business Central Server

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) and later. For later versions, see [Configuring Business Central Server in outdated versions](configure-server-instance-archived.md).

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

When you run [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Setup and install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you provide information that is then used as the configuration for the default [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. This information is stored in a configuration file for the server instance called CustomSetting.config. The default location of the CustomSettings.config file is *[!INCLUDE[prodinstallpath](../developer/includes/prodinstallpath.md)]\Service*. 

After you install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you can change any of the settings, including other settings that weren't available to you in Setup.

> [!NOTE]  
> Each [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance has its own CustomSettings.config file.  

## Configure [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] in Setup

You configure the default instance of [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] by running [!INCLUDE[prod setup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)] and selecting one of the following options: 

- Demo Option
- Server Option
- Developer Option
- Customize > Server

After you specify an installation option or customize your component list, the **Specify parameters** pane is displayed in Setup. The list of parameters that you see depends on which components you've selected for configuration. Setup provides a short description for each parameter. 

## Configure [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] after installation
  
After you install [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], you can change the configuration settings in the CustomSettings.config file of a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance in the following ways:  

- Using the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverconfiguration) that is available in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].

    For more information, see [Using administration shell cmdlets to modify settings](configure-server-instance.md#UsingPowerShell).  

- By directly editing CustomSettings.config using a text editor.

    We recommend that you don't directly edit the configuration file, because if you make any errors in typing, the server instance might not start.  

### Restart [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] after modifications

If you use the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or modify the CustomSettings.config file directly, you must restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance before any changes can take effect.

The [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverconfiguration) doesn't always require restarting the server instance. It depends on the configuration setting that you change. There are several settings that are *dynamically updatable*. *Dynamically updatable* means that a server instance restart isn't necessarily required after modification. For more information, see [Modifying dynamically updatable settings](configure-server-instance.md#DynamicSettings).

These settings are indicated by the text **Dynamically Updatable: Yes** in the tables that follow,

## <a name="NavAdminSettings"></a>[!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance settings
  
This section describes all the configuration settings for a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The settings are grouped according to the tabs under which they appear in the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)]. The **Key Name** column displays the name of the setting as it appears in the CustomSettings.config file. It's also the name for the setting when you run the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet.

## General settings
  
The following table describes general settings for the server.  

|Key Name|Description|
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ALLongRunningFunctionTracingThresholdForApplicationInsights|Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) that an AL function can run before a warning event is recorded in the partner's Application Insights resource trace log. If you don't want a threshold, set the value to -1. <br /><br />To collect this telemetry data, the **Application Insights Instrumentation Key** setting must be configured. For information about analyzing this telemetry, see [Analyzing Long Running AL Methods Telemetry](telemetry-al-method-trace.md).<br /><br />Default: -1<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|ApplicationInsightsConnectionString|Specifies the connection string of the Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure to use for gathering and analyzing telemetry data emitted by the server instance. When this setting is configured, the server instance will send telemetry data to Application Insights for analysis and presentation.<br /><br />This is the recommended setting instead of the Application Insights Instrumentation Key. If both settings are used, the Application Insights Connection String takes precedence.<br /><br />This setting only applies to a server instance that is configured as a single-tenant instance. For a multitenant server instance, this setting is ignored, and the Application Insights resource is set on a per-tenant basis, when tenants are mounted.<br /><br />For more information, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md).<br /><br />Default: empty<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ApplicationInsightsInstrumentationKey|Specifies the instrumentation key of the Microsoft Azure Application Insights resource to use for gathering and analyzing telemetry data emitted by the server instance. This setting can be used as an alternative to the Application Insights Connection String setting. It's ignored if the Application Insights Connection String is also specified.<br /><br /> This setting only applies to a server instance that is configured as a single-tenant instance. For a multitenant server instance, this setting is ignored, and the Application Insights resource is set on a per-tenant basis, when tenants are mounted.<br /><br />For more information, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md).<br /><br />Default: empty<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|ClientBuildRestriction|Specifies what happens when a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client tries to connect to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance when the client is running a different build version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] than the server instance.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br />**AlwaysConnect**<br /><br />**WarnClient**<br /> Before connecting the client to the server instance, a message appears that informs the user that the build versions for the client and server instance are different. The user can choose to continue or cancel the connection.<br /><br /> **DoNotAllow**<br /> A message appears that informs the user that the client and server instance build versions are different. The client doesn't connect to the server instance.<br /><br /> **Note:** With the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](../developer/includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], this setting compares the build version of the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] on IIS with the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. It controls the connection between [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] and the server instance.<br /><br /> Default: WarnClient<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|CalendarTwoDigitYearMax|Specifies the last year of the 100-year range for representing two-digit years. This setting determines how two-digit years in dates entered in the client are interpreted. For example, when the value is 2049, then two-digit years are interpreted as a year between 1950 and 2049. For example, if you were to enter *29*, *49*, or *50* for a year, it would be interpreted as either *2029*, *2049*, or *1950*, respectively. If you wanted the year to be interpreted as *2050*, you'd have to enter the four-digit year *2050*.<br /><br />Windows and Windows Server operating systems include a similar setting for 2-digit year entries. The `CalendarTwoDigitYearMax` setting of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance overrides the Windows setting of the computer where the server instance is running. If you want to use the Windows setting of the computer, set `CalendarTwoDigitYearMax` to **-1**.<br /><br />Default: -1<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ServicesCertificateThumbprint|If you use security certificates to protect communications between [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and client services or web services over an open or wide-area network, you must provide the certificate thumbprint to [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] by updating this setting. For more information, see [Using Security Certificates](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md).<br /><br />Default: <br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ClientServicesCredentialType|Specifies the authentication mechanism for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] users of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.<br /><br /> The options are **Windows**, **Username**, **NavUserPassword**, **AccessControlService**, and **None**. For more information, see [Authentication and User Credential Types](Users-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> If you choose **AccessControlService**, you must specify a federation metadata location for use with Microsoft Entra ID. If you choose **NavUserPassword** and specify a token signing key, you can use both NavUserPassword and AccessControlService.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>**None** is for internal use on system sessions and typically shouldn't be used. If you choose **None**, then the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance can't start.</li><li>**ExchangeIdentity** and **TaskScheduler** are for internal use only, and shouldn't be used.</li></ul><br />Default: Windows<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|DataCacheSize|The contextual size of the data cache. The value must be in the range 1-20.<br /><br /> Default: 9<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|  
|DefaultClient|Specifies the client type that is used to generate URLs when the client type is set to Default.<br /><br /> The options are **Conversational**, **Windows**, **Web**, **SOAP**, and **OData**.<br /><br /> Default: Conversational<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|DefaultLanguage|Specifies which of the installed [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] languages on the server instance will be used as the default language in the clients. Set the value to a valid language culture name, such en-US or da-DK.<br /><br /> In the web and tablet clients, this setting determines the language used if the browser's language setting doesn't match any installed language or a language in the **Supported Languages** setting. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Windows client, this value is used if the language setting of the computer doesn't have a match.<br /><br />If there are application-specific configuration settings, this setting will be overridden by the default language setting that is specified in application-specific configuration file. For more information, see [Set-NAVServerAppConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverappconfiguration).<br /><br /> Default: en-US<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|TraceLevel|  Specifies the lowest severity level of custom telemetry events to be emitted and recorded in the event log for the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The events include system telemetry trace events and custom telemetry events. Telemetry events have IDs from  700-706. <br /><br />The setting has the following values, which correspond to the event severity levels (listed from highest to lowest level): **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Normal** (this value corresponds to the **Information** level), **Verbose**, and **Off**.<br /><br />You use this setting to filter out lower-level events from the log. For example, if you set this setting to **Error**, only **Error** and **Critical** events will be logged.<br /><br />Set to **Off** if you don't want to record telemetry events. When set to **Off**, events aren't emitted.<br /><br />**Note:** Telemetry trace events are recorded in the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] channel logs, which you can see in Event Viewer, under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **DynamicsNAV** > **Common** > **Admin**.<br /><br />Default: Normal<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|  
|ExternalTraceLevel|Specifies the lowest severity level of telemetry events from external proxies that you want the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to emit if an error related to the external system occurs on the server instance. This setting pertains to systems and components that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with, like [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] (CRM/Xrm).<br /><br />The server instance listens for event traces from the external proxy. If an error occurs on the server instance, it will emit the last 10 telemetry trace events from the external proxy. The trace events can then be recorded in the Windows event log or picked up by other event trace collection tools.<br /><br />The setting has the following values, which correspond to the event severity levels (listed from highest to lowest level): **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Information**, **Verbose**, and **Off**.<br /><br />Events that have a lower severity level than the set value won't be emitted. For example, if you set this setting to **Error**, only **Error** and **Critical** events will be emitted. Set to **Off** if you don't want to emit any of these events.<br /><br />Default: Error<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes| 
|DisableTokenSigningCertificateValidation|Specifies whether to enable or disable the validation of the token-signing certificate used by Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). If the check box is cleared (or the value set to `false`), the validation is enabled. If the check box is selected (or the value is set to `true`), then validation is disabled.<br /><br />Disable token signing certificate validation when configuring Microsoft Entra authentication with single sign-on.<br /><br />Default: Checkbox cleared; set to `false`. <br />Dynamically Updatable: No |
|ALFunctionTimingEnabled|Specifies whether AL function timing is enabled. When enabled, data about AL extension performance will be collected and can be viewed in Application Insights and page inspection. For more information, see [Analyzing Long Running AL Methods Telemetry](telemetry-al-method-trace.md) and [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](../developer/devenv-inspecting-pages.md).<br /><br />Default: Enabled <br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|ServicesCertificateValidationEnabled|Specifies whether validation is done on the security certificate.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|EnableDebugging|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance starts with debugging enabled.<br /><br /> If this option is enabled, the following occurs:<br /><br /> When the client first connects, all C\# files for the application are generated. C\# files persist between [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] restarts. Application objects are compiled with debug information.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|EnableApplicationChannelLog|Specifies whether to record admin and operational type events in the **Windows Application** log. This setting will record errors, warnings, and information messages that occur on server instance. The events are stored on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].<br /><br /> Because [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance events are always logged to the **Application and Services Logs**, you can disable logging [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance events in the Windows Application log and not lose any data. For more information, see [Monitoring Business Central Server Events Using Event Viewer](monitor-server-events-windows-event-log.md) and [Disable Logging Events to the Windows Application Log](disable-Logging-Events-Windows-Application-Log.md).<br /><br /> **Important:** If you 're using System Center Operations Manager to monitor [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances, don't disable logging to the Windows Application log. If you do, monitoring won't work.<br /><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|EnableALServerFileAccess|Specifies whether AL functions of the file data type can access files on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] computer.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|EnableFullALFunctionTracing|Specifies whether full AL function tracing is enabled on Event Tracing for Windows \(ETW\) sessions.<br /><br /> When this setting is enabled, all AL function calls and statements are traced.<br /><br /> When this setting is disabled, only root AL function calls are traced. Statements and functions that are called from a function aren't traced.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Monitoring Business Central Server Events](monitor-server-events.md) .<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|UseIncrementalCompanyDelete|Specifies whether to delete companies incrementally. If enabled, when you delete a company, the company record is deleted from the database immediately. But the company data that is stored in the SQL tables will be deleted later by a system task in task scheduler.<br /><br />You can override this setting when using the [Remove-NAVCompany cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/remove-navcompany) by setting the -ForceImmediateDataDeletion parameter.<br /><br />  Default: Not enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes| 
|<a name="partialrecords"></a>EnablePartialRecords|Specifies whether records can be partially loaded with only some fields. Other fields are loaded as needed, or in other words, just-in-time loaded.

##  <a name="Database"></a> Database settings
  
The following table describes settings related to the database.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured as a multitenant server instance, then except for the **Database Name**, **DatabaseInstance**, and **DatabaseServer** settings, the settings apply to both the application database and the tenant database.  

|Key Name|Description|  
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|DatabaseInstance|The name of the SQL Server database instance to connect to. If the value is a null string \(""\), [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance connects to the default database instance of SQL Server.<br /><br /> If the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured as a multitenant server instance, then this setting specifies the SQL Server database instance that hosts the application database.<br /><br /> Default: NAVDEMO<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|DatabaseName|The name of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database in SQL Server.<br /><br /> If the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured as multi-tenant server instance, then this setting specifies the application database.<br /><br /> Default: "Demo Database BC \(14-0\)"<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|DatabaseServer|A valid network name for the computer that is running SQL Server.<br /><br /> If the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured as multi-tenant server instance, then this setting specifies the computer that hosts the application database.<br /><br /> Default: The computer that you selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Setup.<br /> Dynamically Updatable: No|

## Extensions settings

The following table describes settings related to working with extensions.

|Key Name|  Description  |
|--------|---------------|
|<a name="profilecache"></a>EnableProfileCacheSynchronization|Specifies whether profile cache synchronization across multiple server instances is enabled. This setting is relevant when there's more than one server instance connected to the same database or tenant. When not enabled, changes done to profile configurations on one server instance won't show on other server instances until the first server instance is restarted. When enabled, profile configuration changes will be automatically synchronized and propagated across all server instances. However, enabling this setting will lower the tenant performance. <br /><br />For more information about profiles and configurations, see [Designing Profiles](../developer/devenv-design-profiles.md).<br /><br />Default: Not enabled (false)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|OverwriteExistingTranslations|Specifies whether to overwrite existing text translations in the base application with text translations included in extensions.<br /><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|RequiredExtensions|Specifies a list of required extensions that can't be uninstalled by using the **Extension Management** page in the client. The extensions can still be uninstalled by using the [Uninstall-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp) of the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].<br /><br />You specify an extension by its AppID (which is a GUID). When you've more than one extension, separate each AppID with a semicolon. The AppID for the BaseApp extension is 437dbf0e-84ff-417a-965d-ed2bb9650972 and System Application extension is 63ca2fa4-4f03-4f2b-a480-172fef340d3f. <br /><br /> Default: Blank or "" (empty string)<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|SolutionVersionExtension|Specifies the ID of the extension whose version number will show as the Application Version on the client's Help and Support page. Typically, you'd use the extension considered to be your solution's base application. If your solution uses the Microsoft Base Application, set the value to `437dbf0e-84ff-417a-965d-ed2bb9650972`. <br /><br /> Default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|

## <a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility settings

The following table describes settings that you can adjust for compatibility with other systems. In most cases, we don't recommend that you change these settings from their default values.

|Key Name|  Description  |
|--------|---------------|
|ALCompatibleDateFormatCultureList|Specifies the list of language cultures for which dates will be formatted the same way they were in older Business Central versions. Values must be valid language culture names, such as da-DK and en-AU. Separate multiple entries with a comma, like: sv-SE,da-DK,en-AU. Use * as the value to specify legacy Al data formatting for all languages cultures.<br /><br /><br />Default: <br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|AllowSessionCallSuspendWhenWriteTransactionStarted|Specifies whether callbacks from the server to clients are allowed during write transactions. <br /><br />Client callbacks, for example, are used when displaying a dialog that requires user input. The setting applies to production and test environments. However, one of the main reasons for testing, to catch cases where a transaction is kept open during the suspension of AL execution.<br /><br />Default: Enabled (check box is selected) <br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|EnableCloudReplicationMaintenance|Specifies whether to keep the cloud replication status in the database up to date. When enabled, synchronize operations on tenants and extensions will update records in the **Intelligent Cloud Status** table, and set change tracking on tables that are configured to [replicate data](../developer/properties/devenv-replicatedata-property.md).<br /><br />Enabling this setting isn't required for migrating most on-premises solutions to the cloud, and you'll improve synchronization and upgrade performance by disabling it.<br /><br /> Default: Disabled (check box is cleared)<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|SecurityProtocol|Specifies the default security protocol level for the server instance. This setting also controls the [HttpClient](../developer/methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-data-type.md).<br /><br />Values: **Ssl3**, **Tls**, **Tls11**, **Tls12**, **SystemDefault**. For more information about these values, see [SecurityProtocolType Enum](/dotnet/api/system.net.securityprotocoltype).<br /><br />Default: **Tls12**<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|UnsupportedLanguageIds|Specifies which installed [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] languages aren't available for use in the clients. Use this setting to prevent including languages that have the same name but different culture identifiers (LCIDs). A culture identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation. For example, the LCID for *Spanish - Spain (Traditional)* is 1034, and *English - United States* is 1033.<br /><br />The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list that contains the LCIDs for each language.<br /><br />Default: **1034**<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ReplaceReportExecutionTimeWithClientTime|Specifies whether to replace the report execution timestamp with the client timestamp instead of the server instance timestamp.<br /><br /> Default: Enabled (check box is selected)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|UseFindMinusWhenPopulatingPage|Specifies whether pages are initially populated by using FIND('-') instead of FIND('=><'). This setting is relevant to pages that display lists in descending order. Enabling this setting ensures that the first record, instead of the last record, is in focus when the page opens. Pages that use the OnFindRecord trigger will ignore this setting and always use FIND('=><').<br /><br /> Default: Enabled (check box is selected)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|UsePermissionSetsFromExtensions|Specifies whether to use permission sets that are defined as AL objects in extensions or as data stored in the database.<br /><br />For more information, see [Entitlements and Permissions Sets Overview](../developer/devenv-entitlements-and-permissionsets-overview.md).<br /><br /> Default: Enabled (check box is selected)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

[!INCLUDE [admin-tlswarning](../developer/includes/admin-tlswarning.md)]

## <a name="Upgrade"></a>Upgrade settings

The following table describes settings related to upgrade.

|Key Name|  Description  |
|--------|---------------|
|IntegrationRecordsTableId|Specifies the ID of the application table that is used to store integration record IDs. This setting only applies when you upgrade from Business Central Spring 2019 (version 14) to Business Central 2019 release wave 2 (version 15). It ensures that current integration record IDs that are used in the application can be used as-is after upgrade. <br /><br />When a database is upgraded, a **SystemId** column will be added to the **Integration Records** table, and each record in the table will be assigned a **SystemId** value. The base application looks to this column to identify integration records. If you specify the **Integration Records Table (ID)** setting, the data upgrade process will set the **SystemId** to the same value as integration record ID; otherwise, the value is randomly assigned by the system. <br /><br />If you aren't upgrading to the Business Central 2019 release wave 2 base application, you can either skip this upgrade step by setting the value to 0. This is the case, when you've a fully customized application or you're only doing a technical upgrade. Or, if you 're using a different integration record table than **5151 Integration Record**, set the value to ID of your custom integration record table. The custom integration record table must include the following columns as a minimum (with exact naming): Integration ID, Record ID, Table ID. <br /> <br />Default: 5151<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|DestinationAppsForMigration| Specifies the extensions that Microsoft and 3rd-party extensions have a dependency on. The dependencies typically include the base application, system application, and test application. Only use this setting when upgrading from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019. The setting is used during the data upgrade process. If configured, when an extension is published, the server instance will automatically modify the manifest of the extension to include the required dependencies.<br /> <br />Default: <br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

## <a name="external-events"></a>External event settings 

[!INCLUDE [2023-releasewave2](../includes/2023-releasewave2.md)]

The following table describes parameters related to the external business events functionality. [Learn more about business events on Business Central](../developer/business-events-overview.md).

|Key Name|  Description  |
|--------|---------------|
|ExternalEventsEnabledServiceLevel|Specifies whether the business events functionality is enabled at the server level. When disabled, this functionality can't be enabled at the environment level. However, when enabled, it can be overridden (disabled) at the environment level.<br /> <br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ExternalEventsEnabledEnvironmentLevel|Specifies whether the business events functionality is enabled by default at the environment level. This setting can be used in conjunction with the 'EnableExternalEvents' environment setting to override behavior for specific environments. If the server setting 'ExternalEventsEnabledServiceLevel' is disabled, however, this setting is ignored. <br /> <br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|ExternalEventsActivityLogRetentionDays| Specifies the number of days records in the **External Event Activity Log** table are retained.<br /> <br />Default: 7<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|ExternalEventsActivityLogCleanupBatchSize| Specifies maximum number of records to remove from the **External Event Activity Log** table during cleanup as a part of a single transaction.<br /> <br />Default: 50000<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

##  <a name="UsingPowerShell"></a> Using [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] to modify server instance settings
  
The [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] includes several `Set-` cmdlets that enable you to create and modify [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.

The main cmdlet for configuring a server instance is the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet. You can use this cmdlet to change any of the configuration settings that are listed in the previous sections. To change a configuration setting, you set `-KeyName` parameter to the **Key Name** that corresponds to the setting, and set the `-KeyValue` parameter to the new value. For example, you can change the value for `DatabaseServer` to `DatabaseServer.Domain.Com` for the server instance named `MyInstance` by executing this cmdlet:  

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance "MyInstance" -KeyName "DatabaseServer" -KeyValue "DatabaseServer.Domain.Com"  
```  

## <a name="DynamicSettings"></a>Modifying dynamically updatable settings

For dynamically updatable settings, use the `-ApplyTo` parameter to specify how to apply the change. The change can be written directly to the configuration file (CustomSettings.config) and applied to the current server instance state. The option you choose will determine whether a server instance restart is required for the change to take effect. The parameter has three options, as described in the following table:

|  Option |Description  |
|-----------|-----------|
|ConfigFile|Saves the change to the configuration file of the server instance. The change won't take effect until the server instance is restarted.|
|Memory|Applies the change only to the server instance's current state. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance. The change is stored in memory. The next time the server instance is restarted, it reverts to the setting in the configuration file.|
|All|Applies the change to the server instance's current setting state (in memory) and to the configuration file. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance.|

For example, the following command sets the value for the `MaxStreamReadSize` key to `42424242`, without having to restart the server instance. 

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstanceMyInstance -KeyName MaxStreamReadSize -KeyValue 42424242 -ApplyTo Memory  
```
